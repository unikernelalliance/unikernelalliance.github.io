Custom OCI annotations, intentionally extensible, are utilized by bima to furnish the runtime with crucial information on how to execute the unikernel. This information includes the storage location of the unikernel within the rootfs, the desired hypervisor type, the necessary command line parameters, and the location of any extra required files.\nCode: https://github.com/nubificus/bima Contact: gntouts at nubificus.co.uk dot co , cmainas at nubificus.co.uk dot co , ananos at nubificus.co.uk dot co ","date":"2023-11-10","id":3,"permalink":"/projects/bima/","summary":"How can we package unikernels in the OCI image format?\nTo address this challenge, we created bima, a tool specifically designed for this purpose.","tags":[],"title":"bima"},{"content":"FlexOS is a unikernel-based OS allowing users to easily specialize the safety and isolation strategy of an OS at compilation/deployment time, instead of design time.

Code can be developed on a normal OS such as Linux or macOS, and then compiled into a fully-standalone, specialised unikernel that runs under a Xen or KVM hypervisor. This lets your services run more efficiently, securely and with finer control than with a full conventional software stack.\nMirageOS applications take a few milliseconds to start-up instead of the few minutes that traditional OSes take. Binaries are self-contained: they do not need an additional OS to execute. Even then, the size of MirageOS binary is usually a few megabytes.\nMirageOS applications are written in OCaml, an industrial strength programming language supporting functional, imperative and object-oriented styles.\nWebsite: https://mirage.io/ Code: https://github.com/mirage Contact: https://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mirageos-devel ","date":"2023-11-10","id":9,"permalink":"/projects/mirage/","summary":"MirageOS is a library operating system that constructs unikernels for secure, high-performance network applications across a variety of cloud computing and mobile platforms.","tags":[],"title":"MirageOS"},{"content":"OSv is an open-source unikernel designed to run a single unmodified Linux application securely as microVM on top of a hypervisor.

We propose two kinds of sockets to build microservices: blocking and non-blocking. Blocking sockets are good for intensive-IO microservices whereas non-blocking sockets are good for microservices that can serve a request without blocking. When a microservice executes in Toro, it runs alone in the system thus leveraging on the VM\u0026rsquo;s resources.\nToro is a set of libraries that compile within the user application, i.e., the microservice. The user can choose which components are included, .e.g, drivers, filesystems, networking, etc. This results in a binary that can run on top of modern hypervisors like KVM, Xen or VirtualBox. Once the kernel has been initialized, the microservice starts to execute. The microservice runs free from interference from other applications and without the need of users, password or remote login.\nWebsite: https://torokernel.io/ Code: https://github.com/torokernel Contact: https://groups.google.com/g/torokernel ","date":"2023-11-10","id":11,"permalink":"/projects/toro/","summary":"Toro is a simple kernel that provides a dedicated API to develop microservices.
