FlexOS is a unikernel-based OS allowing users to easily specialize the safety and isolation strategy of an OS at compilation/deployment time, instead of design time.
Depending on the configuration, the same FlexOS code can mimic a microkernel with multiple address-spaces, a single-address-space OS with Intel MPK compartments, or many other OS isolation approaches.
