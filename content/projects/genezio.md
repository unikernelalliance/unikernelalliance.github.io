genezio is a platform for developers to write and host a serverless application.
You are writing your backend logic in classes and design your frontend using your preferred programming language.

By calling `genezio deploy`, we are deploying your backend classes in a serverless infrastructure.

To make it easy to call your backend logic from the client, an SDK is generated.
You can use it to remotely call the methods of your class in a very natural way.
