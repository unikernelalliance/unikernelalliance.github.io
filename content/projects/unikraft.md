Unikraft is a fast, secure and open source unikernel development kit.
It powers the next-generation of cloud native applications by enabling you to radically customize and build custom OS/kernels, unlocking best-in-class performance, security primitives and efficiency savings.

Unikraft aims for **extreme specialization**, with configurability at its core of its design.
It is fully modular, with a constantly growing ecosystem with many popular open-source operating system and application libraries like musl and openssl available for use, allowing you to pick and choose exactly what you need for your target application.

With the Unikraft companion command-line client `kraft`, you can quickly and easily define, configure, build, and run unikernel applications.
Get everything from OS library dependencies to pre-built binaries and more.

Unikraft technology powers the [KraftCloud platform](https://www.kraft.cloud/).
